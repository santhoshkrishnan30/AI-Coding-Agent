# AI Coding Agent - Architecture Overview

## System Flow Diagram

The AI Coding Agent follows a cyclic process that enables it to assist with coding tasks effectively. The architecture is designed around the Perceive-Reason-Act-Learn loop, with integrated safety mechanisms and learning capabilities.

### Components and Flow

1. **User Input**: The user provides a command or request in natural language.
2. **Perceive**: The agent gathers the current state of the system, including file contents, git status, and relevant context.
3. **Reason**: The agent uses an LLM to analyze the user's request and the current state to formulate a plan of action.
4. **LLM Provider**: The agent selects an LLM provider (Primary or Fallback) to process the reasoning step. This ensures reliability even if the primary provider is unavailable.
5. **Process Plan**: The LLM generates a structured plan, breaking down the request into executable steps.
6. **Select Tools**: Based on the plan, the agent selects the appropriate tools from its registry (e.g., file operations, git commands, code analysis).
7. **Preview & Approve**: Before executing potentially destructive operations, the agent previews the changes and requests user approval. This is a critical safety feature.
8. **Execute Tools**: The agent executes the selected tools to perform the planned actions (e.g., creating files, running tests, committing changes).
9. **Display Results**: The results of the tool execution are displayed to the user in a formatted and readable way, including syntax highlighting for code.
10. **Learn & Adapt**: The agent learns from the interaction, updating its understanding of user preferences and common patterns.
11. **Update Memory**: The learning outcomes are stored in the agent's memory for future reference, enabling continuous improvement.

### Component Classes

- **Core Components (Blue)**: User Input, Perceive, Reason, Display Results. These form the essential loop of the agent.
- **LLM Components (Green)**: LLM Provider, Process Plan, Fallback Mode. These handle the language understanding and generation.
- **Tool Components (Orange)**: Select Tools, Preview & Approve, Execute Tools. These manage the execution of actions with safety checks.
- **Learning Components (Purple)**: Learn & Adapt, Update Memory. These enable the agent to improve over time.

### Key Features

- **Multi-Provider LLM Support**: The agent can switch between primary and fallback LLM providers to ensure reliability.
- **Safety Mechanisms**: The preview and approval step prevents unintended changes to the codebase.
- **Learning System**: The agent adapts to user preferences and patterns, providing more personalized assistance over time.
- **Rich Output**: Results are displayed with formatting and syntax highlighting for better readability.

This architecture ensures that the AI Coding Agent is both powerful and safe, making it a valuable tool for developers.
